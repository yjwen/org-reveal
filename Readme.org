* Reveal.js and Org-Reveal

  - *Reveal.js* is a tool for creating good-looking HTML presentations,
    authored by [[http://hakim.se/][Hakim El Hattab]]. \\
    For an example of a reveal.js presentation, see [[http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/][here]].
  - *Org-Reveal* exports your [[http://orgmode.org/][Org]] documents to reveal.js
    presentations.\\
    With Org-reveal, you can create beautiful presentations with 3D
    effects from simple but powerful Org contents.

* Requirements and Installation

  - Reveal.js.
  - Latest org-mode.
  - ox-reveal.el.
  - htmlize.el (optional, for syntax highlighting).
  - And, of course, emacs.

** Obtain Reveal.js

   Download Reveal.js packages from [[https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/][here]].

   Extract Reveal.js folders from the downloaded zip file.

   If you do not wish to download reveal.js yourself and would rather get a copy from a CDN,
   see the section /Set the location of Reveal.js/

** Obtain org-mode

   *Note*: Org-reveal relies on the Org-mode 8.0 export frame work.
   Pre-packaged org-mode may be out-of-date.

   If in doubt, use the latest development version from the repository.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ git clone git://orgmode.org/org-mode.git
#+END_SRC

    Follow the [[http://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-build-system.html][online instruction]] to build and install Org-mode.

** Obtain Org-reveal

   Download the latest Org-reveal package from [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal][the Org-reveal GitHub page]].

   Or clone the GitHub repository:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ git clone https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal.git
#+END_SRC

   Copy =ox-reveal.el= to the Org-mode installation directory.

   Add the following statement to your =.emacs= file.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(require 'ox-reveal)
#+END_SRC

* Configuration

** Set the location of Reveal.js

   Org-reveal need to know the Reveal.js path relative to the root of
   your website.  The default location is =./reveal.js=.

   Suppose your project homepage resides in
   =http://example.com/myproject/=.  Then by default, all Reveal.js
   components will be accessible under
   =http://example.com/myproject/reveal.js/=.

** Url form for file location

   Set your =REVEAL_ROOT= to the following URL to download reveal.js from
   a CDN instead of downloading a local copy.

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
   ,#+REVEAL_ROOT: http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/reveal.js/2.5.0/
   #+END_SRC


** First Try

   To load Org-reveal, type "M-x load-library", then type
   "ox-reveal".

   Now you can export this manual into Reveal.js presentation by
   typing "C-c C-e R R".

   Open the generated "Readme.html" in your browser and enjoy the
   cool slides.

** The HLevel

   Org-reveal maps each heading and its contents to one Reveal.js
   slide. Since Reveal.js arranges slides into a 2-dimensional matrix,
   Org-reveal use a *HLevel* value to decide whether to map headings to horizontal
   or vertical slides.

   * Headings of level less than or equal to *HLevel* are mapped to horizontal
     slides.
   * Headings with a deeper level are mapped to vertical slides.

   HLevel's default value is 1, means only level 1 headings are arranged
   horizontally. Deeper headings are mapped to vertical slides below their
   parent level 1 heading.

*** HLevel's Affects on Slides Layout

    Assume we have a simple Org file as below:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* H1
,* H2
,** H2.1
,*** H2.1.1
,* H3
#+END_SRC

    If HLevel is 1, the default value, headings H2.1 and H2.1.1 will
    be mapped to vertical slides below the slides of heading H2.

    [[./images/hlevel.png]]

    If HLevel is changed to 2, slides of heading H2.1 will be changed
    to the main horizontal queue, and slides of heading H2.1.1 will be
    a vertical slide below it.

    [[./images/hlevel2.png]]

*** Configure HLevel's Value

    * Change variable =org-reveal-hlevel='s value to set HLevel globally.\\
      For example, add the following statement to your =.emacs= file.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(setq org-reveal-hlevel 2)
#+END_SRC

    * Setting Org files local HLevel to option =REVEAL_HLEVEL=.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+REVEAL_HLEVEL 2
#+END_SRC

** Force Split

   If one heading has too many things to fit into one slide, you can
   split the contents into multiple vertical slides manually, by inserting

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+REVEAL: split
#+END_SRC

#+REVEAL: split

   Now a new slide begins after =#+REVEAL= keyword.

** Select Theme and Transition

    Themes and transition styles are set globally throughout the whole
    file by setting options =REVEAL_THEME=, =REVEAL_TRANS=, and =REVEAL_SPEED=.

    For an example, please check the heading part of this document.

    Available themes can be found in "css/theme/" in the reveal.js directory.

    Available transitions are: default|cube|page|concave|zoom|linear|fade|none.

** Set Slide Background

   Slide background can be set to a color, an image or a repeating image
   array by setting heading properties.

*** Single Colored Background
   :PROPERTIES:
   :reveal_background: #543210
   :END:

    Set property =reveal_background= to either an RGB color value, or any
    supported CSS color format.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,*** Single Colored Background
   :PROPERTIES:
   :reveal_background: #123456
   :END:
#+END_SRC

*** Single Image Background
    :PROPERTIES:
    :reveal_background: ./images/whale.jpg
    :reveal_background_trans: slide
    :END:

    Set property =reveal_background= to an URL of background image.
    Set property =reveal_background_trans= to =slide= to make background image
    sliding rather than fading.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,*** Single Image Background
    :PROPERTIES:
    :reveal_background: ./images/whale.jpg
    :reveal_background_trans: slide
    :END:
#+END_SRC

*** Repeating Image Background
    :PROPERTIES:
    :reveal_background: ./images/whale.jpg
    :reveal_background_size: 200px
    :reveal_background_repeat: repeat
    :END:

    Resize background image by setting property
    =reveal_background_size= to a number.

    Set property =reveal_background_repeat= to =repeat= to repeat
    image on the background.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,*** Repeating Image Background
    :PROPERTIES:
    :reveal_background: ./images/whale.jpg
    :reveal_background_size: 200px
    :reveal_background_repeat: repeat
    :END:
#+END_SRC

*** Title Slide Background Image

    To set the title slide's background image, please specify the
    following options:

    * =REVEAL_TITLE_SLIDE_BACKGROUND=: A URL to the background image.
    * =REVEAL_TITLE_SLIDE_BACKGROUND_SIZE=: HTML size specification, e.g. ~200px~.
    * =REVEAL_TITLE_SLIDE_BACKGROUND_REPEAT=: set to ~repeat~ to repeat the image.

** Slide Size

   Reveal.js scales slides to best fit the display resolution, but you can
   also specify the desired size by settings the option tags =width= and =height=.

   The scaling behavior can also be constrained by setting following
   options:
   * =#+REVEAL_MARGIN:= :: a float number, the factor of empty area
        surrounding slide contents.
   * =#+REVEAL_MIN_SCALE:= :: a float number, the minimum scaling down
        ratio.
   * =#+REVEAL_MAX_SCALE:= :: a float number, the maximum scaling up
        ratio.

** Slide Numbering
   Activate slide numbers by setting =#+REVEAL_SLIDE_NUMBER:= to =t= (true).

** Slide Header/Footer
   Specify Slide header/footer by =#+REVEAL_SLIDE_HEADER:= and
   =#+REVEAL_SLIDE_FOOTER:=. The option content will be put into
   divisions of class =slide-header= and =slide-footer=, so you can
   control their appearance in custom CSS file(see [[Extra Stylesheets]]).

** Fragmented Contents

    Make contents fragmented (show up one-by-one) by setting option
    =ATTR_REVEAL= with property ":frag frag-style", as illustrated
    below.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
    Paragraphs can be fragmented.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
    - Lists can
    - be fragmented.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
    Pictures, tables and many other HTML elements can be fragmented.

*** Fragment Styles
    Available fragment styles are:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
    * grow
    * shrink
    * roll-in
    * fade-out
    * highlight-red
    * highlight-green
    * highlight-blue
    * appear

    Setting ~:frag t~ will use Reveal.js default fragment style, which
    can be overridden by local option ~#+REVEAL_DEFAULT_FRAG_STYLE~ or
    global variable ~org-reveal-default-frag-style~.

*** Fragment Index
    Fragment sequence can be changed by assigning adding ~:frag_idx~
    property to each fragmented element.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t :frag_idx 3
    And, this paragraph shows at last.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t :frag_idx 2
    This paragraph shows secondly.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t :frag_idx 1
    This paragraph shows at first.

*** List Fragments

    ~#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag frag-style~ above a list defines fragment
    style for the list as a whole.
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag grow
    1. All items grow.
    2. As a whole.

    To define fragment styles for every list item, please enumerate
    each item's style in a lisp list.

    ~none~ in the style list will disable fragment for the
    corresponding list item.

    Custom fragment sequence should also be enumerated for each list
    item.

#+REVEAL: split
    An example:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (grow shrink roll-in fade-out none) :frag_idx (4 3 2 1 -)
   * I will grow.
   * I will shrink.
   * I rolled in.
   * I will fade out.
   * I don't fragment.
#+END_SRC

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (grow shrink roll-in fade-out none) :frag_idx (4 3 2 1 -)
   * I will grow.
   * I will shrink.
   * I rolled in.
   * I will fade out.
   * I don't fragment.
#+REVEAL: split
   When there is ~:frag_idx~ specified, insufficient fragment style
   list will be extended by its last element. So a ~:frag (appear)~
   assigns each item of a list the ~appear~ fragment style.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   * I appear.
   * I appear.
   * I appear.
#+END_SRC
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   * I appear.
   * I appear.
   * I appear.


** Data State
   :PROPERTIES:
   :reveal_data_state: alert
   :END:

   Set property =reveal_data_state= to headings to change this slide's
   display style, as illustrated above.

   Available data states are: alert|blackout|soothe.

** Plug-ins

   Reveal.js provides several plug-in functions.

   - reveal-control : Show/hide browsing control pad.
   - reveal-progress : Show/hide progress bar.
   - reveal-history : Enable/disable slide history track.
   - reveal-center : Enable/disable slide centering.
   - multiplex : Enable audience to view presentation on secondary devices.

*** Configure Plug-ins

    Each plugin can be toggled on/off by adding =#+OPTIONS= tags or
    by setting custom variables.

    - =#+OPTIONS= tags:\\
      =reveal_control=, =reveal_progress=, =reveal_history=,
      =reveal_center=, =reveal_rolling_links=, =reveal_keyboard=, =reveal_overview=
    - Custom variables:\\
      =org-reveal-control=, =org-reveal-progress=,
      =org-reveal-history=, =org-reveal-center=, =org-reveal-rolling-links=, =org-reveal-keyboard=, =org-reveal-overview=

    For an example, please refer to the heading part of this document.
** Source Codes

   Org-reveal use Org-Babel to highlight source codes.

   Codes copied from [[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/The_Fibonacci_sequence][Haskell Wiki]].
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell

fibs = 0 : 1 : next fibs
       where next (a : t@(b:_)) = (a+b) : next t
#+END_SRC

   If you saw odd indentation, please set variable =org-html-indent=
   to =nil= and export again.

   If code is not highlighted, please make sure =htmlize.el= is installed.

** MathJax
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: my-heading
  :END:


   ${n! \over k!(n-k)!} = {n \choose k}$

   LateX equation are rendered in native HTML5 contents.

   *IMPORTANT*: Displaying equations requires internet connection to
   [[http://mathjax.org/][mathjax.org]] or local MathJax installation.

   *IMPORTANT 2*: MathJax is disabled by default to reduce internet
   traffic. Set =#+OPTIONS= tag =reveal_mathjax= or variable
   =org-reveal-mathjax= to true to enable it. For local MathJax
   installation, set option =REVEAL_MATHJAX_URL= to the URL pointing
   to the local MathJax location.

** Preamble and Postamble

   You can define preamble and postamble contents which will not be
   shown as slides, but will be exported into the body part of the
   generated HTML file, at just before and after the slide contents.

   Change preamble and postamble contents globally by setting variable
   =org-reveal-preamble= and =org-reveal-postamble=.

   Change preamble and postamble contents locally by setting options
   =REVEAL_PREAMBLE= and =REVEAL_POSTAMBLE=, as illustrated at the
   heading part of this document.

   To add custom contents into HTML =<head>= parts, set contents to
   variable =org-reveal-head-preamble= or option
   =REVEAL_HEAD_PREAMBLE=.

*** Generating Pre/Postamble by Emacs-Lisp Functions

    If the contents of pre/postamble is the name of an evaluated
    Emacs-Lisp function, which must accept an argument of Org-mode
    info and return a string, the returned string will be taken
    as pre/postamble contents.

    So you can embed the Emacs-Lisp function as an Org-Babel source
    block and mark it to be evaluated when exporting the document.

** Raw HTML in Slides

   Besides the Org contents, you can embed raw HTML contents
   into slides by placing a =#+REVEAL_HTML= keyword.

   The famous cat jump fail:
#+REVEAL_HTML: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQzJR3BqS7o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

** Speaker Notes
   Reveal.js supports speaker notes, which are displayed in a separate
   browser window. Pressing 's' on slide's windows will pop up a window
   displaying the current slide, the next slide and the speaker notes on the current
   slide.

   Org-reveal recognize texts between =#+BEGIN_NOTES= and =#+END_NOTES=
   as speaker notes. See the example below.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* Heading 1
   Some contents.
,#+BEGIN_NOTES
  Enter speaker notes here.
,#+END_NOTES
#+END_SRC

#+REVEAL: split
   Speaker notes requires the ~notes~ plug-in. If you changed default
   plug-in setting by specifying =#+REVEAL_PLUGINS= or by setting
   variable =org-reveal-plugins=, please make sure ~notes~ is in the
   plug-in list to enable speaker notes.

#+REVEAL: split

   Due to a bug in Reveal.js, sometimes the speaker notes window
   shows only blank screens. A workaround to this issue is to put
   the presentation HTML file into the Reveal.js root directory and
   reopen it in the browser.

** Multiplexing
   Reveal.js supports multiplexing, which allows allows your audience to view
   the slides of the presentation you are controlling on their own phone, tablet
   or laptop. As the master presentation navigates the slides, all client
   presentations will update in real time. See a demo at
   http://revealjs.jit.su/.

   You can enable multiplexing for your slide generation by including the
   following options:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
#+REVEAL_MULTIPLEX_ID: [Obtained from the socket.io server. ]
#+REVEAL_MULTIPLEX_SECRET: [Obtained from socket.io server. Gives the master control of the presentation.]
#+REVEAL_MULTIPLEX_URL: http://revealjs.jit.su:80 [Location of socket.io server]
#+REVEAL_MULTIPLEX_SOCKETIO_URL: http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/0.9.10/socket.io.min.js
#+REVEAL_PLUGINS: ([any other plugins you are using] multiplex)
#+END_SRC

   You must generate unique values for the =REVEAL_MULTIPLEX_ID= and
   =REVEAL_MULTIPLEX_SECRET= options, obtaining these from the socket.io server
   you are using.

   If you include these options in your .org file, reveal-org will enable your
   .html file as the master file for multiplexing and will generate a file named
   in the form =[filename]_client.html= in the same directory as the client
   .html file. Provide your audience with a link to the client file to allow
   them to track your presentation on their own device.

** Extra Stylesheets

   Set =REVEAL_EXTRA_CSS= to a stylesheet file path in order to load extra custom
   styles after loading a theme.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+REVEAL_EXTRA_CSS: url-to-custom-stylesheet.css
#+END_SRC

** Select Built-In Scripts

   Set option =REVEAL_PLUGINS= or variable =org-reveal-plugins= to a
   lisp list to select built-in scripts.

   Available built-in scripts are:
   classList/markdown/highlight/zoom/notes/search/remotes.

   Default built-ins are: classList/markdown/highlight/zoom/notes/multiplex.

   The following examples select /markdown/ and /highlight/ only.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+REVEAL_PLUGINS: (markdown highlight)
#+END_SRC

** Extra Dependent Script

   Set =REVEAL_EXTRA_JS= to the url of extra reveal.js dependent
   script if necessary.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+REVEAL_EXTRA_JS: url-to-custom-script.js
#+END_SRC

** Extra Slide Attribute

   Set property =reveal_extra_attr= to headings to add any necessary attributes
   to slides.

** Export into Single File

   By setting option =reveal_single_file= to ~t~, images and necessary
   Reveal.js scripts will be embedded into the exported HTML file, to make
   an portable HTML.

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
   ,#+OPTIONS: reveal_single_file:t
   #+END_SRC

   When exporting into single file, functions provided by Reveal.js
   libraries will be disabled due to limitation, including PDF export,
   Markdown support, zooming, speaker notes and remote control.

   Code highlight by highlight.js is also disabled. But *code
   highlight by Emacs is not effected.*

* Tips

** Disable Heading Numbers

   Add =num:nil= to =#+OPTIONS=
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+OPTIONS: num:nil
#+END_SRC

** Internal Links

   Reveal.js supports only jump between slides, but not between
   elements on slides. Thus, we can only link to headlines in an Org
   document.

   You can create links pointing to a headline's text, or its
   custom-id, as the examples below:

   * [[Tips]].
   * [[#my-heading][Heading]] with a =CUSTOM_ID= property.

* Thanks
