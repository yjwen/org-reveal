* Reveal.js and Org-Reveal

  - *Reveal.js* is a tool for creating good-looking HTML presentations,
    authored by [[hakim.se][Hakim El Hattab]]. \\
    For an example of reveal.js presentation, click [[http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/][here]].
  - *Org-Reveal* exports your [[orgmode.org][Org]] documents to reveal.js
    presentations.\\
    With Org-reveal, you can create beautiful presentations with 3D
    effects from simple but powerful Org contents.

* Requirements and Installation

  - Reveal.js.
  - Latest org-mode.
  - ox-reveal.el.
  - And, of course, emacs.

** Obtain Reveal.js

   Download Reveal.js packages from [[https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/][here]].

   Extract Reveal.js folders from the downloaded zip file.

   If you do not wish you download reveal.js and want to use a CDN
   version, see the section /Set the location of Reveal.js/

** Obtain org-mode

   *Note*: Org-reveal relies on the Org-mode 8.0 export frame work.
   Pre-packaged org-mode may be out-of-date.

   If not sure, use the freshest development codes from git repository.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ git clone git://orgmode.org/org-mode.git
#+END_SRC

    Follow the [[http://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-build-system.html][online instruction]] to build and install Org-mode.

** Obtain Org-reveal

   Download latest Org-reveal package from [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal][the Org-reveal GitHub page]].

   Or clone the GitHub repository:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ git clone https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal.git
#+END_SRC

   Copy =ox-reveal.el= to the Org-mode installation directory.

   Add the following statement to your =.emacs= file.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(require 'ox-reveal)
#+END_SRC

* Configuration

** Set the location of Reveal.js

   Org-reveal must know where Reveal.js is on your computer before
   exporting Org contents. The location of Reveal.js is the path to
   the top directory of Reveal.js packages, the one which contains
   file *README.md*, but *not* the one contains file reveal.js.

   The default location is =./reveal.js=, relative to the Org file.

   Change variable =org-reveal-root= 's value will change the location
   globally. For example, add the following statement to your .emacs
   file:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(setq org-reveal-root "file:///d:/reveal.js")
#+END_SRC
   *IMPORTANT*: the absolute path to Reveal.js should be in URL form,
   "file:///path_to_reveal.js", as illustrated above.

   By setting option =REVEAL_ROOT=, the location is only affected
   within the Org file.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+REVEAL_ROOT: file:///d:/reveal.js
#+END_SRC

   Set your =REVEAL_ROOT= to the following URL, to use reveal.js from
   a CDN, instead of downloading your local copy.

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
   ,#+REVEAL_ROOT: http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/reveal.js/2.5.0/
   #+END_SRC


** First Try

   To wake-up Org-reveal now, type "M-x load-library", then type
   "ox-reveal".

   Now you can export this manual into Reveal.js presentation by
   typing "C-c C-e R R".

   Open the generated "Readme.html" in your browser and enjoy the
   cool slides.

** The HLevel

   Org-reveal maps each heading and its contents to one Reveal.js
   slides. Since Reveal.js arranges slides into a 2-dimentional matrix,
   Org-reveal use a *HLevel* value to decide map headings to hozirontal
   or vertical slides.

   * Headings of level less or equal to HLevel are mapped to hozirontal
     slides.
   * Headings of deeper levels are mapped to vertical slides.

   HLevel's default value is 1, means only level 1 headings are arranged
   horizontally, deeper headings are mapped to vertical slides below its
   parent level 1 heading.

*** HLevel's Affects on Slides Layout

    Assume we have a simple Org file as below:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* H1
,* H2
,** H2.1
,*** H2.1.1
,* H3
#+END_SRC

    If HLevel is 1, the default value, headings H2.1 and H2.1.1 will
    be mapping to vertical slides below the slides of heading H2.

    [[./images/hlevel.png]]

    If HLevel is changed to 2, slide of heading H2.1 will be changed
    to the main hozirontal queue, and slide of heading H2.1.1 will be
    a vertical slide below it.

    [[./images/hlevel2.png]]

*** Configure HLevel's Value

    * Change variable =org-reveal-hlevel='s value to set HLevel globally.\\
      For example, add the following statement to your =.emacs= file.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(setq org-reveal-hlevel 2)
#+END_SRC

    * Setting Org files local HLevel to option =REVEAL_HLEVEL=.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+REVEAL_HLEVEL 2
#+END_SRC

** Force Split

   If one headings has too many things to fit into one slide, you can
   split the contents into multiple vertical slides manually, by inserting

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+REVEAL: split
#+END_SRC

#+REVEAL: split

   Now a new slide begins after =#+REVEAL= keyword.

** Select Theme and Transition

    Themes and transition styles are set globally throughout the whole
    file by setting options =REVEAL_THEME=, =REVEAL_TRANS=, and =REVEAL_SPEED=.

    For an example, please check the heading part of this document.

    Available themes can be found in "css/theme/" in the reveal.js directory.

    Available transitions are: default|cube|page|concave|zoom|linear|fade|none.

** Set Slide Background

   Slide background can be set to a color, an image or a repeating image
   array by setting heading properties.

*** Single Colored Background
   :PROPERTIES:
   :reveal_background: #543210
   :END:

    Set property =reveal_background= to either an RGB color value, or any
    supported CSS color format.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,*** Single Colored Background
   :PROPERTIES:
   :reveal_background: #123456
   :END:
#+END_SRC

*** Single Image Background
    :PROPERTIES:
    :reveal_background: ./images/whale.jpg
    :reveal_background_trans: slide
    :END:

    Set property =reveal_background= to an URL of background image.
    Set property =reveal_background_trans= to =slide= to make background image
    sliding rather than fading.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,*** Single Image Background
    :PROPERTIES:
    :reveal_background: ./images/whale.jpg
    :reveal_background_trans: slide
    :END:
#+END_SRC

*** Repeating Image Background
    :PROPERTIES:
    :reveal_background: ./images/whale.jpg
    :reveal_background_size: 200px
    :reveal_background_repeat: repeat
    :END:

    Resize background image by setting property
    =reveal_background_size= to a number.

    Set property =reveal_background_repeat= to =repeat= to repeat
    image on the background.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,*** Repeating Image Background
    :PROPERTIES:
    :reveal_background: ./images/whale.jpg
    :reveal_background_size: 200px
    :reveal_background_repeat: repeat
    :END:
#+END_SRC

** Slide Size

   Reveal.js scales slides to best fit the display resolution. But in case
   the auto-sizes are not satisfiable, you can specify the desired size by
   option tag =width= and =height=.

   The scaling behavior can also be contrainted by setting following
   options:
   * =#+REVEAL_MARGIN:= :: a float number, the factor of empty area
        surrounding slide contents.
   * =#+REVEAL_MIN_SCALE:= :: a float number, the minimun scaling down
        ratio.
   * =#+REVEAL_MAX_SCALE:= :: a float number, the maximum scaling up
        ratio.

** Slide Numbering
   Activate slide numbers by setting =#+REVEAL-SLIDE-NUMBER:= to =t= (true).

** Fragmented Contents

    Make contents fragmented (show up one-by-one) by setting option =ATTR_REVEAL= with
    property ":frag frag-style", as illustrated below.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
    Paragraphs can be fragmented.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
    Items can be fragmented, too.

    Availabe fragment styles are:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag grow
    * grow
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag shrink
    * shrink
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
    * roll-in
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag fade-out
    * fade-out
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag highlight-red
    * highlight-red
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag highlight-green
    * highlight-green
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag highlight-blue
    * highlight-blue

** Data State
   :PROPERTIES:
   :reveal_data_state: alert
   :END:

   Set property =reveal_data_state= to headings to change this slide's
   display style, as illustrated above.

   Availabe data states are: alert|blackout|soothe.

** Plug-ins

   Reveal.js provides several plug-in functions.

   - reveal-control : Show/hide browsing control pad.
   - reveal-progress : Show/hide progress bar.
   - reveal-history : Enable/disable slide history track.
   - reveal-center : Enable/disable slide centering.

*** Configure Plug-ins

    Each plug-ins can be set on/off by adding =#+OPTIONS= tags or
    settinng custom variables.

    - =#+OPTIONS= tags:\\
      =reveal_control=, =reveal_progress=, =reveal_history=,
      =reveal_center=, =reveal_rolling_links=, =reveal_keyboard=, =reveal_overview=
    - Custom variables:\\
      =org-reveal-control=, =org-reveal-progress=,
      =org-reveal-history=, =org-reveal-center=, =org-reveal-rolling-links=, =org-reveal-keyaboard, =org-reveal-overview=

    For an example, please refer to the heading part of this document.
** Source Codes

   Org-reveal use Org-Babel to highlight source codes.

   Codes copied from [[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/The_Fibonacci_sequence][Haskell Wiki]].
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell

fibs = 0 : 1 : next fibs
       where next (a : t@(b:_)) = (a+b) : next t
#+END_SRC

   If you saw odd indentation, please set variable =org-html-indent=
   to =nil= and export again.

** MathJax
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: my-heading
  :END:


   ${n! \over k!(n-k)!} = {n \choose k}$

   LateX equation are renderred in native HTML5 contents.

   *IMPORTANT*: Displaying equations requires internet connection to
   [[mathjax.org]] or local MathJax installation.

   *IMPORTANT 2*: MathJax is disabled by default to reduce internet
   traffic. Set =#+OPTIONS= tag =reveal_mathjax= or variable
   =org-reveal-mathjax= to true to enable it. For local MathJax
   installation, set option =REVEAL_MATH_JAX_URL= to the URL pointing
   to the local MathJax location.

** Preamble and Postamble

   You can define preamble and postamble contents which will not be
   shown as slides, but will be exported into the body part of the
   generated HTML file, at just before and after the slide contents.

   Change preamble and postamble contents globally by setting variable
   =org-reveal-preamble= and =org-reveal-postamble=.

   Change preamble and postamble contents locally by setting options
   =REVEAL_PREAMBLE= and =REVEAL_POSTAMBLE=, as illustrated at the
   heading part of this document.

   To add custom contents into HTML =<head>= parts, set contents to
   variable =org-reveal-head-preamble= or option
   =REVEAL_HEAD_PREAMBLE=.

*** Generating Pre/Postamble by Emacs-Lisp Functions

    If the contents of pre/postamble is the name of an evaluated
    Emacs-Lisp funtion, which must accept an argument of Org-mode
    info and return a string, the returned string will be taken
    as pre/postamble contents.

    So you can embed the Emacs-Lisp function as an Org-Babel source
    block and mark it to be evaluated at exporting the document.

** Raw HTML in Slides

   Besides the Org contents, you can embed raw HTML contents
   into slides by placing a =#+REVEAL_HTML= keyword.

   Now break time, listen to a girl's song.

#+REVEAL_HTML: <video  src="http://naga-eda.org/home/yujie/lengwanwan_youthtime.mp4"></video>

** Speaker Notes
   Reveal.js supports speaker notes, which are displayed in a seperate
   browser window. Press 's' on slide windows will pop up an window
   displaying current slide, next slide and the speak notes on current
   slide.

   Org-reveal recognize texts between =#+BEGIN_NOTES= and =#+END_NOTES=
   as speaker notes. See the example below.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* Heading 1
   Some contents.
,#+BEGIN_NOTES
  Enter speaker notes here.
,#+END_NOTES
#+END_SRC

#+REVEAL: split

   Due to a bug in Reveal.js, sometimes the speaker notes window
   shows only blank screens. A workaround to this issue is to put
   the presentation HTML file into the Reveal.js root directory and
   reopen it in the brower.

** Extra Stylesheets

   Set =REVEAL_EXTRA_CSS= to a stylesheet file path in order to load extra custom
   styles after loading a theme.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+REVEAL_EXTRA_CSS: url-to-custom-stylesheet.css
#+END_SRC

** Extra Dependent Script

   Set =REVEAL_EXTRA_JS= to the url of extra reveal.js dependent
   script if necessary.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+REVEAL_EXTRA_JS: url-to-custom-script.js
#+END_SRC

** Extra Slide attribute

   Set property =reveal_extra_attr= to headings to add any necessary attributes
   to slides.

* Tips

** Disable Heading Numbers

   Add =num:nil= to =#+OPTIONS=
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+OPTIONS: num:nil
#+END_SRC

** Internal Links

   Reveal.js supports only jump between slides, but not between
   elements on slides. Thus, we can only link to headlines in an Org
   document.

   You can create links pointings to a headline's text, or its
   custom-id, as the examples below:

   * [[Tips]].
   * [[#my-heading][Heading]] with a =CUSTOM_ID= property.

* Thanks
